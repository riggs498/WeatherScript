==== Additonal Notes Regarding "tts_audio.sh" Script ====

I now have a wrapper program that will lock the program so that only one 
instance can be run at a time to prevent issues with the Text To Speech (TTS). 
In addiion, For the TTS scripts, it's now a separate script that you can call.  
It will return the ulaw file name once it's converted.  There is one caveat, 
the line needs to be less then 100 characters. If the sentence goes over 
100 characters and you are using the -s option, there is a pause (like a 
period) in the audio. It's important to keep your sentenances short.  If 
you are not using the -s option, then the line that has over 100 characters
will not be converted.

There is also an option to split the text file so that it will split on 
periods and if the line length is greater that 100. Keep in mind that it 
the line is split due to being greater that 100, it will have a pause in 
the audio.

This script can be used to create other audio files.  The syntax is:

   tts_audio.sh [-s] [FILE]  

      where -s splits the file at periods and long lines.

This script will return a path/file to the converted ulaw audio file.


If you run into issues, please let me know.

Chris,  W0ANM
